# Getting Started!

If you want to start playing Minecord Classic , find a server with Minecord on its member list and type `m!start` in the chat! After doing so, you will receive a set of wooden tools, a wooden pickaxe, a wooden sword, and a wooden axe!

### Now, what can I do with them?

You can use `m!mine` for mining with your pickaxe, `m!fight` to fight mobs with your sword, and `m!chop` for chopping trees! Spamming these commands wouldn't help, though! Each command has a 5-second, 40-second, and 60-second cooldown, respectively.

### I got items, what's next?

You can check your inventory with `m!inventory` and sell them with `m!sell <item> <amount>` or `m!sell <all>` . Then you can buy items in the shop with `m!buy <item name>` (e.g. `m!buy stone pickaxe`). You can check items in the shop with `m!shop <category>`. For example, you can check pickaxes with `m!shop pickaxe`. You can also equip tools with `m!equip <tool name>`. You can check how much your items will sell for with `m!value`.

### BONUS: Tips and Tricks!

#### You can vote for Minecord Classic for free stuff!

By [voting for Minecord](https://top.gg/bot/625363818968776705/vote), you will receive chests for your rewards. Open the chests with `m!chest <amount>` or `m!chest all` for amazing items like emeralds, along with your regular loot!

#### Aliases

Did you know instead of typing `m!mine` you can type `m!m` instead? It also works for `m!fight` as `m!f` and `m!chop` as `m!c`! It even works for the inventory command with `m!i`and the value command with `m!v`!

#### Stuck anywhere?
