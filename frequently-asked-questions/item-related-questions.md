# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

## Wait, what happened to my previous account?

If you were using Minecord before August 31st, 2021, your previous items and stats are in [Minecord Classic](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/739822344377335850/739822484731461642/878287138196709456). You can join the server by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/pReP2fTYzX) or using the command `m!classic`.

## What do Boss Keys do?

Boss keys can be used to summon and fight the Wither, or they can be used to attack the Ender Dragon.

## What do Nether Stars do?

[Nether stars](https://just-a-squid.gitbook.io/minecord-1/v/minecord/statistics/experience#nether-stars) are given upon the Wither's defeat. Usually, players obtain one nether star, but looting improves the chances to provide the player with two nether stars. Nether stars give you a slight XP multiplier for the next 24 hours.&#x20;

## How do enchantments work?

[Enchantments](https://just-a-squid.gitbook.io/minecord-1/v/minecord/statistics/enchantments#introduction) will apply to all of your tools. For example, fortune will apply to all of your pickaxes. If you purchase an enchantment, then a pickaxe. The newly purchased pickaxes will also receive the enchantment. Efficiency is the only enchantment to apply to commands and not tools. For information on an enchantment, you can do `m!info <enchantment>`.

## What are Emeralds, Lapis, Redstone, and Tokens used for?

Emeralds are among the most common items you receive. They are only used for two purposes: Heals during Wither fights and Rebirth. Lapis is used for purchasing enchantments. Redstone is used for buying autominers. Tokens are used to buy Omnitools, a donator exclusive. All three are received from voting, but emeralds and lapis are also received upon [leveling up](https://just-a-squid.gitbook.io/minecord-1/statistics/experience#levels).

## How do I get unbanned?

Join the [Minecord Support Server](https://discord.gg/n8h5nvq). Then, in #support, send a screenshot containing the verification request with your attempts to answer the verification. Then, wouldn't you mind waiting patiently for a staff member who may ask you for a few questions or additional screenshots? Alas, you can be unbanned if you possess the evidence needed.

## How to change the current tool?

You just spent that 1k on the nice stone pickaxe. But when you mine, you find yourself still using the wooden pickaxe. Fret not! You can do `m!equip stone pickaxe`!  You can still switch back to your wooden pickaxe with `m!equip wood pickaxe`.

## How to fight the Ender Dragon?

On the first week of every month, you can run the command `m!enderdragon` or `m!ed`. However, each ender dragon attack will consume a boss key. Without boss keys, you will not be able to attack the Ender Dragon. Upon the defeat of an Ender Dragon, everyone will receive a drop and an XP multiplier for the next 24 hours!

## How does an autominer work?

An [autominer](../statistics/autominer.md) gives the user items like what you would receive normally. They will be added automatically to the user's inventory. When the autominer has completely elapsed, the user will receive a DM regarding the autominer's summary.

## What are Omnitools?

[Omnitools](https://just-a-squid.gitbook.io/minecord-1/v/minecord/statistics/omnitool) are semi-auto miners. They can give you resources when you issue enough commands. These resources can be collected with `m!omni`.
