# Getting Started (Advanced)

### Starting off!

After receiving your tools from `m!start`, you can use the `m!vote` command to vote for Minecord. From voting, you will receive chests that you can open with `m!chest all`. Then, you would join the [Minecord Support Server](https://discord.gg/n8h5nvq) and sell your redstone, lapis, and emeralds in [#trading](https://discord.com/channels/739822344377335850/739823662735163482).&#x20;

### Iron tools headstart!

So purchase Iron Sword and Iron Axe, if possible, Pickaxe as well. By using this strategy, you will skip stone tools entirely. By using a Minecord Assistant, players can grind more efficiently, and gain more money in a short time. Keep grinding until you have enough to purchase a gold tool, buy a gold sword, followed by its axe, finally its pickaxe counterpart. Don't forget to vote periodically, as well (lapis and redstone will be proven useful)!

### Diamond Tools and Beyond!

From Gold Tools, buy a full set of Diamond Tools in the order of Sword, Axe, and Pickaxe. After you reach Netherite, buy a full set of Netherite Tools. At this stage, you should consider purchasing Enchantments. Enchantments should be bought in the following order: Looting 1, Fortune 1, Efficiency, Looting 2, Fortune 2, Looting 3, Fortune 3, Sharpness 1, Sharpness 2, Sharpness 3. When you are done with these Enchantments, you should be ready to purchase Inferno Tools, again, in the order of Sword-Axe-Pickaxe. After this point, consider using boss keys in wither fights for an extra 5% XP boost per star.

### Pacing

By playing Minecord 50 minutes a day, granted, this will take you around two week to finish, and once you reach Inferno Tools, you could consider donating to Minecord, as not only do Tokens sell for a lot, but Omni Tools are also a passive income gain!

### Post Mid-Game.

After maxed Inferno Tools, grind your way to Ultimate Tools.
