# Current Position

Generally, Diamond tools to Inferno tools are considered as "mid-game." While grinding, players should be about introduced to enchantments, armor, boss fights, and trading. 

# Enchantments

These can be purchased with a a few hundreds for lapis. Fortune increases Pickaxe drops. Looting increases mob loot, while Sharpness increases sword damage against bosses during boss fights. Efficiency decreases cooldowns on the mining, fighting, and chopping commands, by 1 second, 10 seconds, and 15 seconds, respectively.

The suggested order of purchase is Looting 1, Fortune 1, Looting 2, Fortune 2, Efficiency, Looting 3, Fortune 3, Sharpness 1, Sharpness 2, Sharpness 3. This order can be altered to personal preference.

# Armor

Armor decreases fight cooldown to as low as 10 seconds. It is a good strategy to skip all armor upgrades and just purchase Netherite Armor. Armor also works well with effiency to lower the cooldown even further.

# Trading

Trading is a good way to purchase resources. Selling resources to others is not always recommended, because there aren't as many buyers to sell towards. A general price apiece is Emeralds at 2k, Lapis at 50k, and Tokens at 10m. This should never be a main way to earn money.

# Final Focus

At this point, you should have emeralds to purchase Emerald Tools. Check [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tfm24k199gKojgjT5Z0aIkNQ3rKTz9vLJSP5xVDbEn0/edit?usp=sharing) for the statistics of every tool, and make your choices wisely. (Tip: Emerald axes are a waste of time)
