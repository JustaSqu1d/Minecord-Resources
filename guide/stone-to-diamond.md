# Tool Tiers

Stone tools are great and all, but you get much past iron. If you have to speedup the earning process, buy the tools for the next tier!

# Verifications

Verifications are roadblocks. Don't fret, because they have a short detour. Simply follow instructions to continue with your adventure. Some of the common mistakes are `12`, `m!verify`, `m!verify <12>`, or `m!verify answer`. If the answer to the addition is 12, type `m!verify 12`.
