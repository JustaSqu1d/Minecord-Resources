# Trivia (Less Known)

### Minecord's Developer's Hobbies

Panicakr, the Minecord developer, has been seen playing Terraria, League of Legends via the Discord Rich Presence, but for Minecraft? Not once.

### Useless Emeralds

If you think Emeralds were useless now, it was nothing to how they were back in Minecord Classic 1.0.0. You just received them from level-ups, but nothing to spend on. Fortunately, tools were added later that could be bought with emeralds and even a wither that you could summon.

### Quirky Lapis

Before Lapis was Lapis, it was actually named Ruby. However, Rubies do not exist in Vanilla Minecraft, Lapis and Redstone went with a vote, and Lapis won. Eventually, Redstone was added a year later with the feature of automining.

### Restarts

Minecord has a history of resets. Whether it be the Minecord 2.0, Minecord Classic, Minecord Purge, or the Minecord Original, they have had tremendous impacts on the Minecord community (usually member loss).

### Events

There have been a total of 6 events. All of which introduced at least a new tool. There has been a Christmas 2019, Coronavirus event, Infection event, Halloween 2020 event, Christmas 2020 event, and an Easter 2021 event. The Coronavirus event ended with a reset, so the Infection event has been hosted for compensation.
