# Enchantments

### Introduction

Enchantments have been a staple in Minecord's history. They were one of the major causes for lapis barters, and also offers a fruitful reward.

Players can purchase Tier 1 Enchantments for 100 Lapis, Tier 2 for 200 Lapis, and the final Tier for 300 Lapis. The only exception is the Efficiency enchantment, which has 1 Tier that costs 750 Lapis.
