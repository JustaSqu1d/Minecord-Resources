# Omnitools

### Introduction

Omnitools are donator-exclusive tools that can be purchased with tokens. The player can charge them with progressive commands, when finished charging, the Omnitool's gains can be collected. Each Omnitool requires sets of commands to charge.

You also cannot skip Omnitool tiers. So in order to reach Omega you must purchase Beta and Alpha, as well.

Players can use `m!omni` or `m!o` to check their charging progress. When fully charged, players can tap the Collect button to receive items.
