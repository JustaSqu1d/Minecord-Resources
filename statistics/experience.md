# Experience

### Experience Gains

Experience is gained through progressive commands (`m!mine`, `m!fight`, `m!chop`). Experience can be used to level up.

<table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th data-type="number">Default Cooldown</th><th data-type="number">Experience per usage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mine</td><td>5</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Fight</td><td>40</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Chop</td><td>60</td><td>60</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Levels

When leveled up to the next level, the user will receive X emeralds in accordance to the X level they have leveled up to. Every 10th level, the user will receive a single piece of lapis.
