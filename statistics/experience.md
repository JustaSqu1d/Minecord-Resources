# Experience

### Experience Gains

Experience is gained through progressive commands (`m!mine`, `m!fight`, `m!chop`). Experience can be used to level up.

<table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th data-type="number">Default Cooldown</th><th data-type="number">Experience per usage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mine</td><td>5</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Fight</td><td>40</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Chop</td><td>60</td><td>60</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Levels

When leveled up to the next level, the user will receive X emeralds in accordance to the X level they have leveled up to. Every 10th level, the user will receive a single piece of lapis.&#x20;

### Experience Multipliers

#### (Nether) Stars

Stars can be used to increase XP gain. Upon defeating the wither (`m!wither`), the wither will guarantee a nether star drop. Each star grants an extra 5% XP gain.

<table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th data-type="number">0 Stars (+ 0%)</th><th data-type="number">5 Stars (+25 %)</th><th data-type="number">10 Stars (+ 50%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mine</td><td>10</td><td>12.5</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Fight</td><td>40</td><td>50</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Chop</td><td>60</td><td>75</td><td>90</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Ender Dragon Buff

Every first week of the month, the Ender Dragon will be open for combat (`m!enderdragon`) When the Ender Dragon is defeated, everyone will get an XP multiplier for the next 24 hours. The amount of XP multiplied is unknown, believed to be 2x.
