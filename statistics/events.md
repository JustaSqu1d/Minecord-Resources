# Events

### Christmas 2019 \[Minecord Origins]

The first-ever event from Minecord started with players collecting when mining. When they found 1000 pieces of candy, players could purchase a Christmas Sword. This Christmas Sword killed Snow Golems and dropped snowballs.

### Coronavirus 2020 \[Minecord Origins]

This event took place in April, players collected germs from fighting Zombies/Drowndeds. These would have a chance to drop a germ. Upon collecting 1000 germs, players could redeem a Coronavirus Sword. Sadly, this event ended in a glitch corrupting the Minecord database, so only one player actually got the sword.

### Infection 2020 \[Minecord Classic]

After Minecord's reboot, this event has been hosted again, but instead of collecting germs, players collected viruses from mining. These 1000 germs could then be redeemed for an Infected Sword. This sword gave users Infected Flesh that sold for 20 and dropped 20-40 per cast. This sword's texture re-used the Coronavirus Sword's texture. Near the end of the event, players could trade viruses.

### Halloween 2020 \[Minecord Classic]

This event is the longest-lasting event, spanning over a month. Users collected candy (recycled from Christmas 2019). When a user collected 1000 candies, players could buy a Pumpkin Pickaxe, Candy Core Sword, or a Bat Axe. Pumpkin Pickaxe dropped 3-5 Pumpkins that sold for 54. Candy Corn Sword slain ghasts for 19-34 Ghast Tear which sold for 20 each. Bat Axe chopped 5-10 Warped Hyphae that sold for 25. Similar to the Infection event, players could trade near the end of the event.

### Christmas 2020 \[Minecord Classic]

This is arguable one of the best events of Minecord. Users collected snow via an event command `m!dig`, yielding 1-3 snow. One could also donate for a diamond shovel that could dig 3-6 snow. After collecting 1000 snow, users could purchase a Christmas Sword (used the 2019 texture) that dropped 1-2 snowballs that sold for 20 (later changed to 2020). After collecting 2020 snowballs and 2020 snow, players could redeem the best event pickaxe of alltime, the 2020 Pickaxe. This pickaxe mined 1-2 TNT that sold for 2020. Unlike previous events, all event items were tradeable from start to finish.

### Easter 2021 \[Minecord Classic]

Argueably the most underwelming event. Users received an Easter Axe, that could be used to collect Easter Eggs (with a Easter Bunny) which its prices increase by 50 for every 100 chops with the Easter Axe. Furthermore, the Easter Axe changed texture for every 100 chops as well. This event lasted for approximatly a week.

### Minecord 2nd Anniversary \[Minecord 2.0] (Canceled)

This event rumored to occur, but never actually came.

### Halloween 2021 \[Minecord 2.0] (Canceled)

The Halloween 2021 event was planned, but because of lack of planning, this never made it to the public. However, by using `m!help` players could find a `m!quest` command and by using `m!help quest`, it read "View your progress on the Halloween quests!" This command still exists today.

### Christmas 2021 \[Minecord 2.0] (Canceled)

This event was hinted by the developer but never made it to Minecord. Reasons for this are unknown.
