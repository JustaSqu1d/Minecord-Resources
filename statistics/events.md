# Events

### Halloween 2021 (Canceled)

The Halloween 2021 event was planned, but because of lack of planning, this never made it to the public. However, by using `m!help` players could find a `m!quest` command and by using `m!help quest`, it read "View your progress on the Halloween quests!" This command still exists today.

### Christmas 2021 (Canceled)

This event was hinted by the developer but never made it to Minecord. Reasons for this are unknown.
