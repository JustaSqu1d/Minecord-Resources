# Omnitool

### Introduction

Omnitools are donator-exclusive tools that can be purchased with tokens. The player can charge them with progressive commands, when finished charging, the Omnitool's gains can be collected. Each Omnitool requires different sets of commands to charge.

You also cannot skip Omnitool tiers. So in order to reach Omega you must purchase Beta and Alpha, as well.
